# todo-app
A JavaScript ToDo app

I made this app using a online tutorial, you can see the tutorial [here](https://medium.com/@Linda_Ikechukwu/building-a-to-do-list-app-with-vanilla-javascript-e27dda195fea), or you can view my version [here](https://timothy-wilson.github.io/todo-app/). On the app you can add todos delete todos and save your list so you can veiw it later.
